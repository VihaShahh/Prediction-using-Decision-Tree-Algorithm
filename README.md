# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

I'm excited to showcase my latest project named "Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm." ðŸŒ³

ðŸ“Š In this project, I explored the famous Iris dataset to predict the species of Iris flowers using a Decision Tree Algorithm. Let's dive into the key points:

ðŸ“Œ *Data Exploration:* I started by importing and exploring the dataset. It contains information about Sepal and Petal dimensions of three different Iris species.

ðŸ“Œ *Data Visualization:* I created visualizations to understand the data better. I used pair plots to visualize relationships between features and a correlation heatmap to identify feature correlations.

ðŸ“Œ *Data Preprocessing:* After analyzing the data, I prepared it for modeling. This included scaling the features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

ðŸ“Œ *Model Building:* I used a Decision Tree Classifier to build the predictive model. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 95.56%.

ðŸ“Œ *Confusion Matrix:* I also generated a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance on different Iris species.

ðŸ“Œ *Decision Tree Visualization:* To gain insights into the decision-making process of the algorithm, I created a visualization of the Decision Tree.

ðŸŒŸ This project demonstrates the power of Decision Tree Algorithms in classification tasks and their interpretability. Feel free to explore the code and dataset on my profile.
